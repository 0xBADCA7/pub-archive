Buffer underflow by bad url-path resolution '../blablabla'

Overwrites a structure with pointers to context structs for
output filters.

It looks like the context array address discovery in the exploit is a bit
dependant on the size of the config file. It SHOULD work with the default
config. If not, install the version with debugging symbols and use r->ctx
(as seen in gdb.)
